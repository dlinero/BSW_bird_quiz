# Bird Quiz (Photos + Sounds)

This R script was developed as a study tool for students in the Birds of Southern Wisconsin course at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The script does the following:

- Retrieves publicly available **photo links** from the [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/) photo galleries
- Retrieves publicly available **sound links** ([Macaulay Library assets](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/)) from the [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/) sound pages.
- Runs a simple **quiz** that shows one random item and reveals the answer after you press ENTER.
